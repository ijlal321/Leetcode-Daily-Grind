# **Intuition**

This section explains why the problem is considered easy and how the constraints simplify the approach. 

# **Approach**

This section details the steps involved in solving the problem. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Transformation:** The original point is translated to a new coordinate system for efficient representation.
2. **Hashing:** A set is used to store the visited coordinates.
3. **Iterating through the path:** The direction characters ('N', 'S', 'E', 'W') are processed one by one.
    - The coordinates are updated based on the direction.
    - A hash is generated from the new coordinates.
    - If the hash already exists in the set, it means a revisit occurred, so the function returns true.
    - Otherwise, the new hash is added to the set.
4. **Returning Result:** After iterating through the entire path, if no revisits were found, the function returns false.

# **Complexity**

This section analyzes the time and space complexity of the solution.

* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the path. This is because each character in the path is processed only once.
* **Space Complexity:** O(n),  In the worst case, the set will store up to n unique coordinates visited throughout the path.
