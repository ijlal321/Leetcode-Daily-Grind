# Intuition
The problem requires transforming a given string into a sequence of integers and then repeatedly summing the digits of this sequence k times. Finally, the resulting integer needs to be returned.

# Approach
1. Convert each character of the string s into its corresponding numerical value (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).
2. Concatenate these numerical values to form a single string.
3. Perform the sum of digits of this string k times.
4. Return the resulting integer.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** O(n×k), where n is the length of the input string s. This is because for each iteration of the while loop, we sum the digits of the string str, which takes O(n) time. Since we repeat this process k times, the overall time complexity is O(n×k).
- **Space complexity:** O(n) since we are creating a string of length n to store the transformed version of the input string s.
