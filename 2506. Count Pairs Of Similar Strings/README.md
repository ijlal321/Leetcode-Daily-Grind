 **Approach**

**Key Algorithm:**

1. **Character Presence Array Creation:**
   - Initialize a 2D boolean array `arr` with dimensions `N x 26`, where `N` is the number of words.
   - Rows represent words, columns represent letters (a-z).
2. **Character Presence Tracking:**
   - Iterate through the `words` array.
   - For each string:
     - Convert characters to lowercase.
     - Mark corresponding characters' columns as `true` in `arr`.
3. **Pair Comparison:**
   - Iterate through `words` again.
   - Compare each pair of strings for similarity:
     - If their `arr` rows are identical, increment the similar pair count.

**Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(N^2)
   - Nested loops dominate, leading to quadratic time complexity.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N * 26)
   - The 2D boolean array `arr` requires space proportional to `N` and the alphabet size.
